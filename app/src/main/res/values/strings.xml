    A special hunter who can &quot;level up&quot;.
    After the &quot;Double Dungeon&quot; incident,
    this former E-Rank hunter gained
    access to a &quot;system&quot; that helped him
    become more powerful.
    Though once nicknamed
    &quot;The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind&quot;,
    he now has the ability to
    turn the dead into his &quot;Shadow Soldiers.&quot;
